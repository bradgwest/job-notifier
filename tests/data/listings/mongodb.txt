Field Engineering is linking the work of teams engaged on application modernization roles with our Product and Engineering teams.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since the invention of RDBMS, the cost of storage (and compute) has dropped by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time the requirements towards systems in terms of scalability, resiliency and availability have increased massively. To take advantage of ubiquitous cheap storage a new generation of database technologies have been developed with MongoDB emerging as the “dominant document database”.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many organisations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating cost, and inability to run on cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organisations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernisation programs. Because MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency and developer experience in the cloud as well as on premises, organisations are continuously migrating workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Currently, these transformations are very time intensive and often risky.
